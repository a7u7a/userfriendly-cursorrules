Ideas I can use for my cover letter:
- As a designer who is versed in strategy but also likes obsesing over the technical the idea of going into software felt very natural. 
- Something I should mention about my experience writing code and designing, including usability and accesibility, really experiencing the challenges of bringing a solution from idea and turning that into production-ready code. Thinking about the journey of the data from db to client and all its transformations and also exceptions. I understand the pains of the designer and developer and have learned to integrate both disciplines. Having said that I’m best at working with desginers and creative people, bringing their ideas into real world solutions. A designer’s job is to try a thousand ideas and bring them to a stage where they seem plausible enough. In a way we could think of software development as the opposite of that. Take an idea that seems plausible and hammer it into actual working software. With the infinite challenges and constraints involved. I think my unique pov is that I’ve have experience making both worlds communicate. I will stay humble and just say I dont feel like an expert yet and I supect it may be a problem without an optimal solution, a wicked problem. Nevertheless I’m very interested in this subject as well as the evolution of the relationship between these two roles.
- Design wants to do something new every time, and code is about giving guarantees. They are naturally at odds with each other. If you want to mix them you have to become good at making them work together, to compliment each other. I think this boils down to starting in small iterations. How to break down an idea into manageable steps. With the experience of knowing what tools to prototype with. Having the right mindset to distinguish what the important feature to validate are, how to minimize risk and maximize discovery, at really fast speeds today’s technologies allow us better than ever to fuse technical and creative processes. 
- I also think designers make great at hunting for bugs as well as debugging, because of our simultaneous (obsessive) attention to detail and user experience.
- In order to work a design techologist  I’ve had to develop a series of work  methods, in trying to make a profitable software you have to 
-  more into consistency, starting something and finishing it.  I’m interested in best practices and always strive to write the cleanest typescript code possible. You can check samples of my code in my github



Benefits I’ve experienced blending code and design into my process:
- I can design interfaces taking broader system-design considerarions in mind. 
    - From the client side: CSS and HTML, effects and component architecture. 
    - To server side operations like static site generators, authentication and data piplelines.
    - I’m also a big Typescript fan
- I have experience with data wrangling and ML.
- With the help of LLMS
- If I want to achieve a desired graphic effect/interface, I’m able to decompose a particular effect into its constituent parts using industry standard algorithms and best practices. If (I dont know I know where to start prototyping) which to construct almost anything you wanna make. This allows me to implement non-default solutions that would otherwise require a larger team of experts to produce.
- I’m know how to rapid-prototype. I can create functional mvp’s with which to test core concepts quickly (value engineering?)
- I can optimize software to achieve best performance. I’m familiar with paralelism and asynchronous programming patterns.
- While I try to achieve the highest coding standards possible I’m not a code evangelist. I dont think everything should be custom programmed. Lets be more strategic and leverage the many off the shelf tools that are out there and make our lifes easier. Its all about being strategic with what you want to achieve.
- I (think) I can recognize when something is too much for me and when to involve other experts.

Drawbacks:
- I’m bad at estimating. This is why I’ve created this tool.
- I’ve made mistakes by being overconfident of my programming habilities/lack of experience. Like any other developer. But I’ve also done my best to learn from them.


I’d say I’m front-end focused and back-end aspirational. I have experience running Js and Python server-side. I create API’s and do data wrangling, I can deal pretty well with managend backends like Vercel, Netlify, Supabase, Sanity, even some experience with AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean.

In my experience as developer I usually embed myself within an organization and provide software for both public-facing as well as internal tools development.

The site is made as a catalgue of possibilities, as demonstration of sensibilities and hability to deliver on complex projects. Hability to communicate. Attention to detail.
To the creative audience its meant to open up the apetite and possibilities of working with me. For the technical person someone who is also technical and solutions oriented, value engineering, etc.

- User centered approach, 

but also are performant and truly aligns with your long term strategy.
Where the challenge is to develop custom non-default user interfaces.

Here you'll find a few of the projects I've worked on. They are selected because they were fun but also challenging. They made me learn something new.

You're probably thinking: "There's a wild variety of projects here", and I would agree with you.
I've been lucky to get involved in all sort of interesting projects and I think thats great. I tackle all projects with curiosity and a desire to understand the problem and an openness to non linear development.

I try to leverage my technical skills and the lowering barrier of entry for new technologies as a way of blurring the boundaries between design and engineering. 

Creating meaningfull solutions is a wicked problem. It involves a tight integration and tradeoff between competing requirements that are not always technical. The real problem is mostly a human one. Not a tech one.

Content, usability, growth strategy, future goals and expectations, performance requirements, style. These are all things that are inevitable put into a dialogue during development.

I integrate creative and technical requirements with an eye for excellent user interfaces and aesthetics. 

Something about AI

I'm also curious about broader subjects like human-computer interfaces, energy efficiency and human perception.
 

About my stack choices

I’ve invested a lot of time in becoming proficient in javascript frameworks that make my job easier and let me focus on solutions that provide actual, immediate value.

Tools such as Typescript, Tailwind, Next.js, R3F, GSAP, D3.js Framer Motion and platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Sanity CMS, Mux video, Supabase. They allow me to explore solutions faster while also using best practices in software development.

Having said that, I’m also not an advocate for any particular framework and I believe that tooling choices must be made based on the unique requirements for each project.

I use LLMS to code and I have some things to say about that. If you are interested.

I work with a global network of specialists in adjacent areas such as UX/UI, graphic design, motion design, 3D modelling, video game development, generative design, AI, electrical engineering. 


How I work

In my experience, great projects are the result of a team of people working in close collaboration.

I dont work alone in a cave.
I dont just take your specs and come back with the implemented solution.
I will need your attention:
- I will want to understand your problem
- I will expect you to come into a project with an open mind: The right solution might not be what you expect.
- I will expect you to provide content samples early in the development process. 
- I will need your feedback on the latest changes.
- I will need your eye for doing QA and catching bugs.
