On-Call Responsibility

As a team, we all share on-call responsibilities. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault-tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

About AWS

Diverse Experiences
AWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn’t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don’t let it stop you from applying.

Why AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. We pioneered cloud computing and never stopped innovating — that’s why customers from the most successful startups to Global 500 companies trust our robust suite of products and services to power their businesses.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, it’s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.

Amazon Leadership principles:
- Customer Obsession: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
- Ownership: Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
- Invent and Simplify: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
- Are Right, A Lot: Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
- Learn and Be Curious: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- Hire and Develop the Best: (Secondary, according to my contact)
- Insist on the Highest Standards: Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
- Think Big: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
- Bias for Action: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
- Frugality: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
- Earn Trust: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
- Dive Deep: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
- Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
- Deliver Results: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
- Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer: (Secondary, according to my contact)
- Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility



Current stage of the application: Phone interview coming, tbd.

Here is what the amazon hiring docs say about the coming phone interview:
Your technical phone screening will be with a leader on our team. It will last 60 minutes. Half of the time will be spent on questions that focus on our Leadership Principles and the other half will be spent on front-end coding problems.

Behavioral-based interviewing
Our interviews are rooted in behavioral-based questions. These questions ask about past situations or challenges you’ve faced and how you handled them, using Leadership Principles to guide the discussion.

We avoid brain teasers (e.g., “How many windows are in Manhattan?”). We’ve researched this approach and have found that those types of questions are unreliable when it comes to predicting success at Amazon.

Here are some examples of behavioral-based questions:

1. Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions. What was the problem and how did you determine the course of action? What was the outcome?

2. When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow?

3. Describe a time you took the lead on a project.

4. What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of people or promote collaboration on a project?

5. How have you used data to develop a strategy?

When you respond, be sure to focus on the question asked. Ensure your answer is well-structured and provide examples using metrics or data if applicable. Reference recent situations whenever possible.

Familiarize yourself with Amazon’s Leadership Principles for behavioral questions. There’s no need to memorize them.
Prepare a few specific examples related to your recent projects, team interactions, and product deliveries (avoid confidential information).
Emphasize the importance of data and analytics in supporting your decisions, as Amazon is data-driven.
Highlight how your decisions or projects impacted customers and stakeholders, demonstrating customer obsession.

Technical phone screening
Your technical phone screening will be with a leader on our team. It will last 60 minutes. Half of the time will be spent on questions that focus on our Leadership Principles and the other half will be spent on front-end coding problems.
Coding
Problem solving: We’re evaluating how you comprehend and explain complex ideas. Are you providing the reasoning behind a particular solution?
Developing and comparing multiple solutions: Are you using appropriate data structures? Are you speaking about space and time complexity?
Coding: Can you convert solutions to executable code? Is the code organized and does it have the right logical structure? Is the HTML you’re writing semantic and does it follow Web Standards?
Verification: Are you considering a reasonable number of test cases or coming up with a good argument for why your code is correct?
Communication: Are you asking for requirements and clarity when necessary, or are you just diving into the code? Don’t forget to ask questions.
Thinking big: Is the code you’re writing going to scale for one or any type of user? Have you considered accessibility implications? Can your user interact with the application you have written without the need for a mouse?

Tips
Be familiar and ready to solve technical questions on concepts like front-end application design, data structures, and algorithms. This will likely include qualifying requirements, checking edge cases, and white boarding your solutions with our engineers. Phone screenings tend not to be as in-depth as interview loops.
Be prepared to discuss technologies listed on your resume, e.g. if you list JavaScript or Ruby as technical competencies, expect technical questions about your experiences with these technologies. It’s helpful to review the job description before your interview to align your qualifications against the job’s specific requirements and responsibilities. When listing frameworks, be prepared to speak about these in depth and compare to other frameworks.
Brush up on problem solving and computer science fundamentals. “Cracking the coding interview” is a good read.
Share details of your previous and current experiences; be specific and avoid being too high level.
Talk about decisions you personally made and why you made those decisions. Use “I” and not “we.”
Talk about scope and how you delivered the end result (don’t just explain how the system works).
Examples should explain what the impact (end result) was. Provide examples that have significant impact.
For failure-related questions, it’s okay to be self-critical. Share what you learned, how you recovered, and how you grew.
Include metrics or data and be prepared for follow-up questions.

Project descriptions taken from my personal portfolio website where I show my software development work.

Selected Work

BeigePill Productions
What: Next.js Site
2024
Design: FutureCorp
Stack: WebGL, GSAP, Next.js, Sanity CMS, MUX API
Project description:
I was tasked with building the design system for BeigePill's new website, designed by FutureCorp. Starting from a simple concept and developing it into a performant, full-screen animation.
The current approach uses WebGL's stencil buffer to create the mask and GSAP to control it. Enabling Beige Pill to present their work in line with their premium brand identity. Special thanks to Jack Wild for his technical guidance.

Elemental Chile
What: Next.js Web App
2024
Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Sanity CMS
A minimal site for Elemental Chile, led by Pritzker prize winning architect Alejandro Aravena. They wanted something that felt like an internal tool - brutalist and early-internet inspired. The challenge was to showcase 200+ projects in a way that worked for stakeholder meetings.
The result is a custom app which syncs content from their internal database to a Sanity backend, making it easy for them to keep the site updated. Coupled with a global search feature. Helping people discover connections across their diverse body of work.

PESE.works
Three.js + React Site
2022
StackR3F, TypeScript, Next.js.
Type: Portfolio site
For this site we repurposed a model Pedro created for an exhibition project in Berlin. There was something interesting between the sterile view of the simulation and the photos of the real world objects he wanted to show.
I had to make this little tool to help me find the right animation parameters for making the little scroll-dance between lights, camera and 🌷


Catalina Andonie Portfolio
What: Fullscreen WebGL on React
2022
Stack: StackNext.js, TypeScript, WebGL
Type: Portfolio site
There's a lot of glass and refracting materials in Catalina's work. It seemed like a good opportunity for exploring what could be achieved using fragment shaders on the web.
Projects like this humble you by teaching you that it's one thing to get a cool result by experimentation, but aiming for a specific output is a very different task. Thankfully we have TBoS.

Experimental Work

Scroller Series
Python-based display controller for Raspberry Pi
2022
Stack:Python, Pandas, RPi, World Bank API, Yahoo Finance, Supabase
Comissioned by: Ignacio Gatica
Controller for a custom LED, infinite-scrolling, financial ticker display. Later extended to work with country data, such as international debt and GDP.
The piece explores the significance of money on a planetary scale and has been featured by The Washington Post and Frieze. More info.


Particle simulation
2021
Stack: Three.js, Observable
What: Boids particle simulation
I implemented this boids simulation as part of my journey of learning graphics programming for the web. I was kind of obsessed with code notebooks at the time and ended up using Observable.
As a bonus, I added my take on wind effect using 3D perlin noise vector fields. During the process I also made a lot of smaller notebooks with tests, adapted mostly from The Nature of Code book.


Comfortable Interactions
stack: Python, User Research
2019
Tools: E-paper display, Raspberry Pi, Python, P5.js
What: Alternative interfaces for energy efficiency
Can buildings use natural language to explain what it's doing to keep you warm during winter? Can it give you strategies to make yourself comfortable?
In this project I used HCI research methods to develop and evaluate an interface which lets users communicate with buildings with the goal of improving comfort and lowering energy use. Referencing the interesting work of Stewart Brand, Adrian Clear and Elizabeth Shove.


Fringeless Project
2019
Tools: Python, Google Maps API, thermal printer
What: Generative instructions for city discovery
A fun experiment during DwD week: While living in Edinburgh you realize how much locals dislike when the city gets overrun by tourists during the Fringe Festival.
As a response, we built this tool using Google Maps API, a thermal printer and a handcrafted dataset of interesting locations. It generated unique navigation instructions in puzzle form to get you to the least-crowded-but-still-fun place.


Punto Flotante
Stack: Arduino, Grasshopper3D for Rhino + Ladybug Plugin
2017
Tools: Grasshopper3D, Arduino
What: Solar clock
At the time, I was very interested in forms of screenless tech; I had the opportunity to explore this during a residency at Eigengrau Lab, where I built these computer-controlled mirrors.
Hidden from pedestrian's view, they would reflect the light to a nearby facade, drawing an elliptical pattern each hour through the day. The project was exhibited during the 12th Media Art Biennale 2017, Santiago.
