On-Call Responsibility

As a team, we all share on-call responsibilities. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault-tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.
